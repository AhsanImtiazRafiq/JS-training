// Create two variables: One that holds a fictional user input (a number of your choice) and one that holds no value initially (e.g. "result").

const userInput = 3;
let result;

// Set the result variable to 18 plus the value stored in user input.

result = 18 + userInput; //21

// Add three additional lines of code where you change the result variable again
// (by subtracting a value of your choice, multiplying it and dividing it).

result = result - 1; //20
result = result * 5; //100
result = result / 4; //25

// Think about the value stored in the user input variable you also created - did that value change?

// No, the value in userInput never changed , just the result

// alert() the result and the user input variables (in two separate alert() calls).

alert(userInput);
alert(result);
